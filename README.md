# Vim File Reference 

__Copy And Use File References Like PhpStorm__

There's a great feature in PhpStorm (and other JetBrains editors) that's is
missing in Vim. That's the `Copy Reference` command that copies the path to the
file and the line number to your clipboard. This makes it easy to share your
exact position in the project with another developer. Whether you paste it into
Slack, Discord, or E-mail, is up to you. I've been using this functionality
mapped to my leader key, but I think more developers should use this
- especially when collaborating your felllow developers using PhpStorm.
